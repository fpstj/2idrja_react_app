Hello there!
We are Filip and Viktor, passionate and dedicated individuals with background in web development and a keen interest to learn technology. We are developing this graduating project recently started , which revolved around the creation of an innovative educational website "2drija".

In our project, We set out to design a platform that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of online learning. The website incorporates cutting-edge features, such as call conferences and online courses, to provide a dynamic and interactive learning experience for users. The inclusion of call conferences not only facilitates real-time communication but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration among learners.

One of the key highlights of our graduation project is the integration of mentorship functionalities, booking places in courses. Recognizing the importance of personalized guidance in the learning journey, we implemented a mentorship system that connects students with experienced mentors. This feature not only enhances the learning experience but also creates a supportive environment for students to seek guidance and advice from seasoned professionals.

Throughout the development process, We prioritized user-friendly design and intuitive navigation to ensure a seamless experience for both mentors and learners. The website's interface is designed to be accessible and engaging, making it easy for users to explore courses, participate in call conferences, and connect with mentors effortlessly.

Feel free to explore our portfolio for a closer look at the functionalities and design elements incorporated into my graduation project. we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue exploring the intersection of technology and education, and we are confident that our skills and passion make us valuable assets to any team or project in this field.
